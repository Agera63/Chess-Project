"D:\Engines\stockfish\stockfish-windows-x86-64.exe"

Steps to insert correct path :
1. Place your Stockfish engine in a file (where ever you like).
2. In your "Stockfish" file, find the exectuable file. Here are a list of names it can take :

Windows :   stockfish.exe
            stockfish-windows-x86.exe
            stockfish-windows-x86-64.exe
            stockfish_15_x64_avx2.exe
            stockfish_16_win_x64_popcnt.exe
            stockfish_16_bmi2.exe
            stockfish-15-win-x64.exe
            stockfish-15.1-avx2.exe
            stockfish_16_x64.exe
            stockfish-16-win-avx2.exe

3. On Windows, right-click on the file and select "Copy as path".
4. Modifie the first line of the file and insert that line in the "" at the first line.
5. Run the code and you should be good to go! Have fun!

Possible errors :
(Error reading "StockFishPath.txt" file.) : you moved this file. Delete this and re-download it. Should work then.
(Could not find Stockfish client. ...) : Reread the steps and make sure you did them properly. If you did them correctly,
make sure there are no spaces or extra characters (at the beginning and at the end) in the path. If you want to make
sure the path is fine, erase everything on the first line only and paste the path again. It should work then.
